# Online Course
- Data Science Specialisation - [JHU Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) It is a good course, and the code is in R
- Harvard Data Science Course - [CS 109 Course](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) - Structured in similar way to the approach we shared
<br>
- Many more on Coursera & Udacity...
